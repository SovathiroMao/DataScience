# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Support Vector Machine
## Objective
This was a project initiated to learn the basics and fundamentals of machine learning and in particular support vector machine and how to tune or optimise its associated hyperparameters. 
I have always been interested in healthcare and so I thought a breast cancer model, something which many people have done plenty times before, would be the perfect jumpstart for me who is quite new to machine learning.
This project is divided into 6 sections:
1. Introductions
   - Provide an overview of the problem and how the problem will be tackled
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Understand the data, how features are related to target variables and to other features
5. Data pre-processing
   - Prepare data for analysis
7. Building a SVM model
   - Split dataset, build classifier, evaluate model
9. Optimising SVM algorithm
    - Tune hyperparameters
11. Comparing and finalising model
    - Compare to other potential models, pick the best ones and optimise it further
